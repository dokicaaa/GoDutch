### The idea behind the App

###

 **GoDutch** is a native Android App which simplifies group payments, particularly in situations like splitting a restaurant bill. In many social settings, figuring out who owes what can be a cumbersome and time-consuming task. **GoDutch** aims to make this process seamless by leveraging **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology** to automatically scan and process the bill.

With **GoDutch**, each user can:
- **Scan the bill** quickly using OCR, which recognizes items and their prices.
- **Select the items they ordered**, ensuring a fair split of the total.
- **Calculate their share**, including tip, making it easy to determine how much each person needs to pay.

**GoDutch** removes the hassle of manual calculations, providing a user-friendly way to manage group expenses accurately and efficiently. This app is designed to enhance social experiences by reducing the stress and confusion around bill-splitting, allowing users to focus on what matters – enjoying the moment.
